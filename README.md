## Why this project when we have `react-split-text`?

It seems like the [repo has been abandoned](https://github.com/CyriacBr/react-split-text/issues) since _the last commit was made 4 years ago_ and _there are issues opened since Sep 21, 2020_.

While this project is still not published on NPM, if the PR I opened to fix a responsiveness issue with the original package stales, I'll publish the source code from this project so we have a slightly better version of the package.

Also, just for the sake of transparency, this is a "fork" from the `react-split-text`, so the code is mostly the same. I'm just adding the `ResizeObserver` from my PR
